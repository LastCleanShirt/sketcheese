A Programming language made just for fun, and **not** to be used as a real programming language, the syntax is pretty similar to Ruby and Python to make it simple

# Example
```
$string = "This is a variable, to declare variable use the $,
and to print something, use the out keyword"
$float = 9.9
$integer = 12345

out string!
out float!
out integer!
```

To run the file just type ```py main.py example.sks```
